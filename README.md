# Bored Arena Board
By Jack Mayville

Description:
A game where you play as a little figure on a 10x10 chess board, you have to navigate around the board and attack the enemies from behind in order to clear out the board.
The board's environment will alter and the enemies will get smarter and quicker between each level.
How many boards will you be able to clear?
